Hello Everyone! My name is Jenny and I'm a totally cat person. I have an elegant black cat called "licht". It's a German name means light.

I'm learning CS on my own now and I'm quite passionate to be a front-end engineer in the future! In Github, I list many of my little projects, including bouncing ball, spring, and waves. You can click them to see details. They are super funny and I really enjoy to do these projects. Please feel free to contact with me if you want to know more about me or have job opportunities to communicate. Really appreciate it!
